# Ember CPU Architecture

**Ember** is an ISA im working on. Its pretty simple, and is meant to be pretty simple to emulate, but IDK.

Its also meant to be possible to adapt and change, creating some other architecture based on ember that has all the core functionality of ember but decides on more of the specifics and maybe adds some features. Lacking features are therefore (to an extent) probably/possibly just stuff meant to be added in such an architecture, instead of base ember.

This repo contains the spec of the architecture as well as some sample implementations of an emulator and assembler, but they are just sample implementations. I will make other, more finished, and more modular implementations of the system in the future.

## Current state of the project

Ember is **NOWHERE NEAR** finished. There is still a lot of work to be done on both sample implementations and the spec, and later the actual implementation of an emulator, assembler, and potentially compiler (toolchain) for the system.
