# Ember CPU Architecture

**Ember** is a simple yet feature-rich **16-bit CPU architecture** that I'm
currently developing. The goal of Ember is to create an architecture that is
easy to **emulate** and **implement**, while also incorporating interesting
features drawn from my research into various CPU designs (which could make it slightly harder to emulate in some specific situations).

## Key Features:

- **Simple 16-bit Architecture**: Designed with ease of emulation in mind.
- **Unique Instruction Set**: Incorporates both standard and more advanced
  instructions.
- **Flexible and Extendable**: Designed to be easily extended with additional
  instructions and features in the future.
- **Easy to Implement**: Includes a reference emulator and assembler to help you
  get started quickly (coming  soon).

## Current Status:

Ember is **still a work in progress** and **nowhere near complete**, but
development is ongoing. As I continue to refine the architecture and add more
features, I hope to make the project more robust and ready for broader use. Your
feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Future Plans:

- Clarify the main spec if needed.
- Add stuff that are missing from the spec as I find them.
- Make things like an emulator and assembler.

## Getting Started:

> **Note:** This part will start applying when ember is more finished and there are reference stuff, and is
> not very relevant currently. For now, you have to check the (somewhat unclear, create an issue) spec and make your own tooling.

To get started with Ember, check out the available code and documentation in
this repository. Feel free to fork the project, make improvements, or simply
explore the architecture.
